# Reports Updates

## Overview

Updated dummy reports data and "View" button styling as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reports Repository (`reports_repository_impl.dart`)

- **Dummy Data**: Updated all 5 dummy reports to have `status: 'processed'` and `reportStatus: 1`.
- **Effect**: All reports will now appear as "Published" and the "View" button will be enabled for all of them.

### 2. Reports Screen (`reports_screen.dart`)

- **View Button**: Changed the text and icon color from Black to **White**.
- **Visuals**: The "View" button now has better contrast against the primary color background.

## Result

All dummy reports are now viewable, and the "View" button is styled correctly with white text/icon.
